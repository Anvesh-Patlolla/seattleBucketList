* Mount Rainier
  * In the summer, adventure seekers climb technical glacier routes to summit the massive mountain. Takes 3 hours to get there by car.
* Vancouver, CA
* Bainbridge Island 
  * The view of the Seattle skyline from the ferry is worth the trip alone. The added bonus of strolling around downtown Bainbridgeâ€™s galleries, boutiques, coffeehouses and cafes is even more rewarding. Shop in historic Winslow, which features cute little cafes and island shops offering unusual gifts from the Northwest and beyond.
